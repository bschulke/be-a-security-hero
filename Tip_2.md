# Tip 2: Know what's connected to your network

### Ask yourself these questions:
❓ What's connected to my wifi?

❓ Do I recognize all of the connected devices?

How many of you know what’s connected to your wifi right now? If you don’t, you should definitely find out! 

Checking what devices are connected to your wifi is the easiest way to see if someone (or something) is on your network uninvited. 

There are several ways you can do this depending on how tech-savvy you are. Some routers, like Linksys or Google WiFi, have an easy-to-read list of connected devices. Google WiFi (pictured here) is especially nice because you operate the router from an app on your phone. Your computer can also show you a list of devices on the same network it's connected to, but this may not be as complete a list.

However you go about it, if you see a connected device that you don’t recognize or that looks suspicious, you should change your wifi password. It may be a pain to reconnect your devices, but worth it if that device does happen to be malicious. Then you can figure out what that device is, and block it from your network.
