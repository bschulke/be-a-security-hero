# How to be a Security Hero!
Five easy tips on how to practice good cybersecurity at home

### What is home security?
In this guide, "Home Security" does not mean physical security - like when you lock your doors to keep your house safe. It refers to the security of any computer or computer-like devices you have in your house.

While there are multiple areas you need to consider when practicing cybersecurity, we're going to focus on your home wireless network (or “wifi”), and all of the devices you connect to it every day.

### Why should I care about keeping my home "Cyber-Secure"?
It’s easy to forget that your home wifi needs protecting, because unlike your front door, you can’t easily see who’s going in and out. However, if you aren’t actively trying to secure your home network, it’s like leaving the front door wide open when you go to the grocery store. You’re pretty freaked out when you get back! 

It’s the same for your network; if an attacker connected to your network without your permission, they could get into that fancy work computer your company gave you, or look through your private files on your home computer. Either way, it would be bad!

That’s why it’s up to you to become a Security Hero ™ and keep your devices safe by improving your home security! :)
