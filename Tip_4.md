# Tip 4: Pay attention to app updates for smart devices

### Ask yourself these questions:
❓ Does the app update install new features to my smart device?

❓ What do the new features do, and are they things I want?

You probably have a lot of smart devices at home – there’s smart refrigerators, LED bulbs, thermostats, and the most obvious ones, Amazon Alexa or Google Home. You’ll sometimes hear these called “IoT” or “Internet of Things” devices because they connect to the internet. Your smart toaster may make great toast, but remember, it’s also a little computer.

So, you know what your smart device “does”, but we often underestimate what else it can do. When you buy a new device, you set the thing up, it works, and you move on. You expect it to continue to operate the same way forever. Yet the company can modify its behavior with a single app update.

Like I mentioned in the last tip, updates are important for keeping all of your internet-connected devices secure. However, sometimes a company will add non-essential features that may create some security problems.

For example, in December 2020 Amazon added a new feature to Alexas called "Sidewalk". This feature allows your Alexa device to connect to others like it to create what’s called a “mesh network”. Amazon claims that this will allow you to stay connected to your wifi over a larger area, which initially sounds good. However, Amazon makes that mesh network happen connecting your device to other Amazon devices outside of your home. This is a problem if you're trying to be cyber-secure!

It’s also an “opt-out” feature, so Amazon turned this on for you and it’s up to you to turn it off. As a side note, if you have an Alexa and have not turned this off, you have this feature enabled right now.

If you didn’t realize what features were being installed with your app update, you might not know about this, and have yet another accidentally open window into your private wifi.
