# Tip 5: Create and use guest wifi

### Ask yourself these questions:
❓ How can I keep my private wifi safe?

❓ What devices can I move to guest wifi?

Guest wifi isn’t just for coffee shops and airports – you can set it up for your home, too! 

Why would you want this? Well, think of when you have guests over. Perhaps you close the door to your bedroom, or your office, because you don’t want anyone hanging out in there. That’s a more private space. 

You’re doing the same thing when you have a guest network. If someone comes to visit and they want to use your wifi, they can connect to your guest network, and will be separated from your private network. They don’t need to be able to connect to your work laptop or your printer, they just want to watch YouTube videos without using their data!

While you may not be having a lot of people over right now, another great way to use guest wifi is to connect some of your smart devices to it. Any devices you don’t need to log on to directly – like remote controlled lights, or your thermostat, for example – can be connected to your guest wifi. It’s unlikely, but not unheard of, for an attacker to break into someone’s network through a seemingly harmless smart device, because again, when it’s on your private network, it can see everything else on the network. 

Your router should have instructions for setting up a guest network, and if you have an app for your router, it’s even easier to set up.
