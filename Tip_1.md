# Tip #1: Make sure your wifi is password protected

### Ask yourself these questions:
❓ Do I have a password on my wifi?

❓ Am I using the default/factory password?

When you connect to your wifi on a new device, does it prompt you for a password before you can finish connecting? If not, your wifi is NOT password-protected, and you need to set one!

Also, don’t settle for the password that comes with the box – sometimes companies will use the same default password for every device they sell. This is like the key to your house being able to open every house in your neighborhood. Not really something you’d want!

So, make sure to set up a unique password for your wifi. Your router’s company should have instructions for how to set this up!
