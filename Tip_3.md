# Tip 3: Keep everything updated

### Ask yourself these questions:
❓ Does my computer need to be updated?

❓ Do any smart devices need updates?

Almost everything that connects to the internet is a computer. Your laptop, desktop, and mobile devices are obvious examples, but all of your smart devices are computers, too! Like a computer, they have some kind of operating system or firmware that helps them to run. And, just like your computer, that firmware also needs updating!!

In summary, if any of your devices tell you they need to update, DO IT! Updating your devices helps to keep them, and by extension your wifi, more secure.
